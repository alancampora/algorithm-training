# Algorithms + katas + cci (book exercises)

In our daily jobs, we face different problems, but they are no always realted to difficult algorithms. 
That's why I saw the need of keeping my self training in different algorihtms exercises. 

# Repo structure 
* Kata: solving problems related to https://www.codewars.com
* Cci: solving excersices of **Cracking the Coding Interview 6th edition**
* Algorithms: common problems like quick sort, merge sort and so on.
